Hello! My name is Rusty Yunusoff. I'm a professional storyboard artist, illustrator, animator, and motion graphics designer. I'm a one-man show. I've worked on numerous animation and TV projects in Hollywood, including Golan the Insatiable (airing on FOX) and The Awesomes (streaming on Hulu). I've also worked with numerous ad agencies, including UNIT9, Paleo+Ignite, and Pacific Communications. The list of my clients include Disney, Amazon, Botox, Kroger, and Natrelle. My animated films have been submitted at festivals in Washington, D.C. (Best Animated Short), Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Munich, and Brussels. I love working with people and transforming the written word into a compelling visual story. Let's tell a story together!
